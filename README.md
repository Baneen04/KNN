# KNN
In my project, I have implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify data points based on their proximity to other points.By leveraging this instance-based learning method, I was able to accurately predict the class of a new data point by considering the most frequent class among its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space. This approach allowed for effective classification and pattern recognition, especially in scenarios with well-defined clusters or classes. The KNN algorithm's simplicity and intuitive nature provided a robust solution for various classification tasks within the project.
